# The Bowling Game Kata

## Description

The game consists of 10 frames. In each frame, the player has two opportunities
to knock down 10 pins. The score for the frame is the total number of pins 
knocked down + bonuses for strikes and spares.

A **spare** is when the player knocks down all 10 pins in two tries. The bonus
for the frame is the number of pins knocked down by the next roll.

A **strike** is when the player knocks down all 10 pins on their first try. The
bonux for that frame is the value of the next two balls rolled.

In the tenth frame, a player who rolls a spare or strike is allowed to roll the
extra balls to complete the frame. However, no more than three balls can be
rolled in the tenth frame.
